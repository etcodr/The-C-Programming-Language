# The-C-Programming-Language
My solutions to the exercises from the book.

Really, I am not a very creative person. As a result I needed to find some way to motivate myself to write some code.
I love learning C. It was only natural that I would come across the classic book by Kernighan and Ritchie.
So here I am. Holding myself accountable by forcing myself to post my solutions to the exercises in the book.
